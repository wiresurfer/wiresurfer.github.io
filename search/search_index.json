It was a time when interactions with these computing behemoths were facilitated by peculiar devices known as terminals.</p> <p></p> <p>Picture this: a teleprinter-style contraption resembling a typewriter, affectionately referred to as a \"teletypewriter\" or simply a \"tty.\" These were the portals through which users communicated with the mighty computers. But what was a terminal, really? Etymologically speaking, a terminal was at the end of an electric wire, forming a connection between humans and machines.</p> <p>In the Unix realm, terms like terminal, tty, console, and shell danced intricately in a linguistic ballet. Terminal and tty were once synonymous, representing the text input/output environment. Meanwhile, the console, from a furniture perspective, stood as the physical terminal, the primary link to the machine.</p> <p>As time marched forward, the electronic keyboards and displays became the new norm for terminals. The tty transformed into a specific kind of device file, extending beyond mere read and write commands. Some ttys were born from the kernel, others from terminal emulators like Xterm, Screen, SSH, and Expect.</p> <p></p> <p>The word \"terminal\" also took on a traditional meaning\u2014a device where users interacted with a computer using a keyboard and display. Enter the X terminal, a thin client dedicated solely to human-computer interaction, with applications running on a more potent computer.</p> <p>As the wheels of time went by, terminals started bridging effortlessly larger communication chasm. What started off as same room terminals, soon covered buildings, then grew to campus level machines, and slowly piggy backed on the parallelly influential telecommunications network to enable terminals across miles. </p> <p></p> <p>But what about the console? It wasn't just any terminal; it was the primary one directly connected to the machine. In some systems, like Linux and FreeBSD, the console manifested as several ttys, adding a layer of confusion with names like \"console,\" \"virtual console,\" and \"virtual terminal.\"</p> <p>And then there was the shell\u2014a guiding force, the user's interface upon logging in. Was it the home environment for the user, or the realm where other programs dwelled? The mystery lingered.</p> <p>Unix, being a diverse universe, birthed numerous shells. Bash, Zsh, and fish each brought their unique flavors to the interactive shell scene. Command-line shells allowed users to string together commands, often following the Bourne shell syntax. We had also entered the era of tele-communicaiton. teletypewriters had come a long way. </p> <p></p> <p>As the dust settled, in the intricate dance between the terminal and the shell, tasks were divided. The terminal converted keys into control sequences, while the shell turned these sequences into executable commands. Line editing, input history, and completion were the domains of the shell.</p> <p>Output, on the other hand, belonged to the shell. Instructions like \"display foo,\" \"switch foreground color to green,\" and \"move cursor to the next line\" emanated from the shell, guiding the terminal's actions.</p> <p>As users traversed this digital landscape, copy-pasting and job control became part of their routine. The terminal facilitated inter-application copy-paste, while the shell managed job control, orchestrating programs in the background.</p> <p>Thus, the history of terminals, consoles, and shells unfolded\u2014a tale of technological evolution, linguistic intricacies, and the symbiotic dance between humans and machines in the Unix cosmos.</p>","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/ghost-in-a-shell---what-the-heck-is-a-terminalshelltty/#illustrate-the-problem","title":"Illustrate the problem","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/ghost-in-a-shell---what-the-heck-is-a-terminalshelltty/#talk-about-the-core-idea-of-the-solution","title":"Talk about the Core Idea of the Solution","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/ghost-in-a-shell---what-the-heck-is-a-terminalshelltty/#evidence-about-the-solution-approach","title":"Evidence about the Solution Approach","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/ghost-in-a-shell---what-the-heck-is-a-terminalshelltty/#solution-playbook","title":"Solution Playbook","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/ghost-in-a-shell---what-the-heck-is-a-terminalshelltty/#call-to-action","title":"Call to Action","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"2024/04/07/ghost-in-a-shell---what-the-heck-is-a-terminalshelltty/#footnotes","title":"Footnotes","text":"<ul> <li>What is the exact difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'? - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</li> <li>The TTY demystified</li> <li>Linux TTY Shell Cheat Sheet - Steflan's Security Blog</li> <li>Upgrading Simple Shells to Fully Interactive TTYs - ropnop blog</li> <li>socat</li> <li>Unix Shells and Terminals - by Erik Engheim - Erik Explores</li> </ul>","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"2024/04/18/rise-of-internal-developer-portals-idp---part-1/","title":"Rise of Internal Developer Portals (iDp) - Part 1","text":"<p>In today's rapidly evolving software development landscape, staying ahead of the curve is crucial for success.

One thing which came up was a lack of any serious specialized AI datacenter infrastructure at that time. Some of the key challenges we noted were</p> <ul> <li>GPU/TPU datacentres and the high tarrif to even import these.</li> <li>Infererence datacentres too end up going to Mumbai or Chennai across the     indian internet backbone.</li> <li>Its hard to control where new startups host their AI services. Controlling     data leaving India is hard.</li> </ul> <p>Cut to last month, another friend of mine called me with an inquiry. He was approached by folks to invest in a Datacenter business. Their model was peculiar. They were selling fractional units of the datacenter in 1TB increments. You invested an amount of Rs X for 1TB of capacity which was leased to you for a persiod of 10 years as a depereciating asset. The datacentre folks would then turn around and rent out this capacity and return the investor a monthly rental revenue.</p> <p>I digress as this blog isn't gonna cover the novelty/loopholes in the per TB datacenter business. Thats another can of worms which we will open some other day in an errata.</p> <p>Today I wanted to ask a first principles question which has been bothering me for a while.</p> <p>Is India ready to host its own AI revolution?

But I don't see this as an impossible to solve situation. I am confident products like starlink would drive the cost and feasibility of satellite internet down as soon as we have local playes and regulatory hirdles covered. We also need to think of services we would offer once we connect these brand new users. This could well be a topic for another day, but lets just say, LEO and MEO are gonna get crowded soon.

These cables are crucial for international data transfer, especially for services hosted outside India. However, there is a growing trend towards increasing domestic data center capacity to reduce latency and improve service reliability. This trend is driven by the needs of two of the most ubiquitous and dataintensive services which consumers love! Streaming and Social Media!. Snappy snacable video needs to be cached and served from as close to a user as possible or else we incur a penalty of moving bits over expensive undersea cables. There's also a growing need to keep Indian user generated content withing our national perimeter for reasons as simple as national safety and as far fetched as abuse of indian data for AI training by foreign actors.</p> <p>I say far fetched, but its already happening. A sizeable chunk of content created by Indians lands up on services run by US megacorps. For a brief period, we did indulge Chinese social media apps but a very swift regulatory push saw that door shut pretty quickly.

No seriously, ask any consultant friend of yours</p> <p>Once you have the plan in place, Divide work items into bite sized chunks and predict resources it would consume to get done. At this point resources could be man hours, or it could be some dependency on other bite sized chunks.</p> <p></p> <p>This is best done with tools like OmniPlan or Xmind which can really help you visualise timelines and dependence. [Screenshots are from Omniplan sprint schedules we keep for our interdependent sprints]. Its also invaluable to share this plan with your team because that ways they see the big picture as well as their breadth of responsibility.</p> <p>As part of your sprint plan, choose what you have to work on wisely. Choose things which are core to the problem or which require sufficient thought to be future proofed. Don\u2019t put too much on your plate otherwise you will be too occupied and never have a big picture view of the sprint.</p> <p>Take for Example any enterprise application. If you break up the project into api scaffolding, authentication\u00a0, business objects &amp; decisions, and finally UI. You should ideally work on defining business objects as concretely as possible yourself. While you can delegate the task of brainstorming UI to your dev team sitting with your stake holders.</p> <p>You should definitely sit through these discussions as this helps you hear them go through mock flows. You can update your plans for the business layer to accommodate workflows.</p> <p>If you follow this approach, you would be picking up 20% of the most directly impactful pieces of the project.</p> <p></p> <p>Bite sized chunks of work with pair wise allocation of human capital on critical tasks. Checkpoints are defined and this works as a great template for sync up or milestone meetings.</p> <ol> <li>Always pair up your most (skilled + newest) team members on these 20% directly impactful pieces. What I mean by this is, you should engage someone on your team who hasn\u2019t been exposed to a part of the stack/application,plus someone who knows that part well and split the work between them. This achieves two things, you familiarize someone else with a new part of the product. This is mighty helpful when one team member needs downtime, or you want to engage them in some other firefighting. This way work progresses and you can checkpoint easily. Secondly, both members are forced to communicate what they are thinking. This way, they have a clear picture in their head. If things aren\u2019t clear, they generally get cleared up when a discussion happens. One outsider fresh eyes can ask questions which can untangle some deeply intertwined thoughts for the person already familiar with that part of the project</li> </ol>","tags":["topic/engineering-management","topic/leadership"]},{"location":"2024/03/01/startup-cto-impatient-lazy-and-how-i-learned-the-habit-of-plan-sprint-ship-document/#last-mile-crawl","title":"Last Mile\u00a0Crawl","text":"<p>Usually with any project, there are not one but a couple of 20% chunks. 2 or 3 of these chunks in a project is a healthy number.

Locating the bootloader is done by following a few conventions which have been in the PC world for decades. In short, BIOS has a configured set of boot devices. This preference is stored in the CMOS.</p> <p>After POST, BIOS will start going through each Boot Device and verify if it has a Master Boot Record. This is where GRUB enters the picture. GRUB is a program residing in the Master Boot Record of a bootable device.</p> <p>Here is a quick anatomy of the Master Boot Record. Its the first sector of a disk. A disk sector is traditionally 512bytes. Modern disks have larger sectors up to 4096 bytes [Advanced Format Disks] but even these disks access the physical media in 512byte emulated mode [512e]</p> <p>512bytes of the MBR are broken up as follows</p> <ul> <li>1-446bytes - Bootloader code.

This indicates to the BIOS,     there is a bootloader on this disk device.</li> </ul> <p>With that out of the way, lets look at GRUB as a bootloader.</p> <p>Now. lets be honest. 512bytes is a tight space, and adding things like splash image, nice graphics and menus to dual boot an OS will take way more than 512bytes. For eg. EasyBMP a tiny library to display images on screen when statically linked is 20kb!</p> <p>To work around this limitation, Grub does a multi-stage boot. Stage 1: Boot.img, Fits in 440byte MBR. Its a simple sled program which loads Stage 1.5 using a LBA address jump Stage 1.5: Core.img, Fits in 32kb. It has just enough file system modules to load \\/boot\\/grub. Stage 2: \\/boot\\/grub is a special folder in /boot partition or a path on the root / partition. This is where all grub modules are available. It contains module drives for a large set of IO devices including networking booting. It also brings some nice things like a GUI, selection menus and splash pages!</p> <p></p> <p>Now all that theory out of the way, how do we boot the kernel itself? We usually just select a menu and boom! Linux starts loading up? Well, there is a bunch of configuration files and menu entries which makes that happen. Just peek into <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>. But we aren't looking at GRUB and its magic. Lets try to boot a system by first principles.</p> <p>Here is the minimal set of commands you can use on a GRUB prompt to start a Linux system.</p> <pre><code>insmod linux\nset root=(hd0,1)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic root=/dev/sda1\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic\nboot\n</code></pre> <p>A quick description of what's happening.</p> <ul> <li>Load the linux grub module.

We followed a popular path through the woods of bootloaders and linux kernels. In reality, there are many ways to boot a machine. We've got three components to mix and match. The BIOS, Bootloader and the OS/Kernel.</p> <p>In modern devices with a single powerful System on Chip design, we sometimes encounter BIOS and Bootloader becoming very slim and having features to offer OEM locking and security. In most systems there is a proprietary \"BIOS\".<sup>4</sup></p> <p>Keen readers would noticed how Grub was a two stage bootloader, and Linux kernel was a two stage OS boot system. There have been efforts like Direct Kernel Boot<sup>5</sup> to merge these two components + four steps into a streamlined two step process. This speeds up the boot process and is usually seen as an option in Virtualization solutions and hypervisors.</p> <p>In no particular order or importance, here are some interesting projects powering the modern device bootup space.</p> <ul> <li>U-Boot - Usually used in embedded     devices. Gives fine grained control of where the kernel gets loaded into     device memory. As seen in:<ul> <li>SpaceX Dragon/falcon/</li> <li>Ubiquiti/TP-Link network devices</li> </ul> </li> <li>Coreboot<ul> <li>Chrome OS devices, Lenovo ThinkPad's and</li> </ul> </li> <li>Android Devices :<ul> <li>While android uses a variant of the Linux kernel, there is no standard     boot loader prescribed for running android os.</li> <li>OEMs implement their own boot loader depending on the storage options     available and the SoC used.</li> <li>Qualcomm chipsets use Little Kernel and try to be UEFI compatible.</li> <li>MediaTek chipsets use a variant of U-Boot.</li> <li>Major players like Samsung have their own variants of the bootloader.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cloud VMs : AWS/Azure/GCP support custom virtualized BIOS/UEFI for their     VMs.<ul> <li>Cloud BIOS supports emulating keyboard/serial console during the boot     process, even before the bootloader or OS has loaded. This makes     supporting any standard bootloader possible on cloud infrastructure.     Critical for disaster recovery scenarios where your server, 7000kms away     stops booting!</li> <li>Virtio and OS Images:     Cloud Boot disks are virtualized and attached on demand. You could     explore virtio locally on qemu kvm. Virtualized storage enables     using pre-built images for different operating systems. A superpower for     running repeatable consistent infrastructure at scale!</li> <li>Cloud-Init : They also have additional     initialization steps after the kernel and operating system start called     cloud-init. This helps setup networking, user accounts, passwords     and ssh keys, networking and services. It also helps platform operators     to further extend the boot process.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Have feedback or questions, or want to be notified about more such articles?

The Evolution of Natural Language Processing","text":"<p>An anecdote from NLP illustrates this shift perfectly. In the early 2010s, we struggled with parsing documents and representing them using domain-specific vector models. Bigram and Trigram models were defacto parsing methods and further feature engineering was the buzzword. It was accepted that computers don't understand words or phrases, just vectors and cosine similarity and domain specific tinkering was absolutely necessary to get the best out of any models. In a way, each model was trained for a specific problem, with its own specific features.</p> <p>Word2vec began to change this conception by demonstrating the power of large parameter-trained vector embeddings. When we started framing the problem as \"given a sequence of tokens, predict the next word,\" we forced models to learn long, medium, and short-term relationships between tokens. Whether human knowledge is just a set of token, phrase, and document-level weights remains a fascinating debate.</p> <p>\ud83d\udca1 Insight : Its still a mystery and a raging debate whether human knowledge is just a set of token, phrase and document level weights afterall.</p> <p>Its only when we started training transformer models of sufficiently large parameter space, did we relaize the marvels of transfer learning. Transfer learning is when you train a model on a particular problem, but can use the weights learned by the model on a related problem with minimal retraining. Transfer learning results was the first signs that large transformer models \"knew\" about language. It was only a matter of time till these methods were scaled up with corporate truckloads of money spent in data acquisition and training. Which brings us to our current post ChatGPT era.</p> <p>\ud83d\udca1 Insight : There are parallel innovations in image generation and voice transcription which plays an important second fiddle to the current wave of GenAI llms which I haven't discussed here.

It doesn't inherently know truth from falsehood, correct from wrong, or good from evil. It simply knows how to predict the next most likely token based on its training.</p> <p>Its akin to a human who knows langauge reading and comprehension at a mind boggling rate, but missed any training in science, mathematics and ethics. It does know about history and current affairs, much like how someone who has read a lot of books would. It doesn't have perfect recollection, so it can make mistakes.</p> <p>And worst of all, it still has a computer program's heart, which is, you need to instruct it very precisely to get what you want.

Humans can keep track of the current conversation, what they talked with their family over the last week and their memories from college and use all of these memories in a single conversation without a niggle.

Let's wrap this up with some key takeaways that'll hopefully keep you from falling into the AI hype quicksand:</p> <ol> <li> <p>It's Not Magic, It's a Model: This blog post should have given you a    mental model for thinking about how AI solutions could solve your problems.    Remember, if you're bringing AI into your organization, it shouldn't be a    mysterious black box. You need to understand it, or at least have someone on    your team who does. If you're still scratching your head, don't worry - you    can always tweet me @wiresurfer. I promise I won't bite (much).</p> </li> <li> <p>Wield That Snake Oil Detector: By applying our comprehensive Snake Oil    Detector toolkit, you can cut through the AI hype faster than a hot knife    through butter. A trustworthy AI vendor should be able to address these    points clearly and honestly, acknowledging both the strengths and limitations    of their solution. This toolkit isn't just about evaluating technical    capabilities - it's about ensuring ethical, security, and long-term viability    aspects are thoroughly considered. If you need help evaluating GenAI    solutions, you know where to find me - @wiresurfer on Twitter. I'm always up    for a good AI vendor roast session. If you are an AI vendor, the toolkit    should help you craft your sales interactions and I can help you tweak your    enterprise outreach.</p> </li> <li> <p>Beware the Subscription Apocalypse: Remember the subscription hell we all    found ourselves in? Where each new solution brought with it a recurring OpEx    that made your CFO weep? Well, history has a funny way of repeating itself.    If the GenAI solutions you're eyeing are just thin wrappers on popular LLM    models, it might be time to consider the age-old build vs. buy dilemma. This    could be a blog post in itself (stay tuned), but if you're facing this    challenge now and can't wait for my long-form insights, reach out at    @wiresurfer on Twitter. I'm here to help you avoid death by a thousand    subscriptions.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In the end, GenAI is a powerful tool, but like any tool, it's all about how you use it. Don't let the hype sweep you off your feet, but don't dismiss it as a fad either. Stay informed, stay skeptical, and most importantly, stay curious.</p> <p>And remember, if you ever find yourself lost in the AI wilderness, just send up a flare (or a tweet) to @wiresurfer. I'll be there, armed with a flashlight, a healthy dose of skepticism, and probably a bad AI joke or two.</p> <p>Until next time, keep your BS detectors charged and your AI models ethical!</p>","tags":["topic/deep-dives"]},{"location":"2024/09/10/bike-shedding-and-the-law-of-triviality---lessons-from-the-linux-kernel-conflict/","title":"Bike Shedding and the Law of Triviality: Lessons from the Linux Kernel Conflict","text":"<p>In product teams, especially in open-source communities and startups, bike shedding\u2014focusing on trivial, superficial details at the expense of more significant issues\u2014can derail progress.

While in other situations the situation cause a rift between people. In trying to write my thoughts down, I came across some great writing and saw this picture. There it was hiding on a blog page of an AI integration company who was helping a consulting client of mine.</p> <p></p> <p>It was so well thought out that I had my aha! moment.</p> <p>So today we will talk about two circles in this diagram. Radical Candor and Trust.</p> <p>Key ingredient, or rather, the pre-requisite for Radical Candor to work is Radical Trust.</p> <p>I have been working with a few teams and got a peek into their culture as an outsider. This is a welcome change from me being one of the protaganists in my usual roles. I keep seeing situations where the teams have an element of depleted trust. With the luxury of not being affected directly from these situations, I got to look at patterns from my past experiences at my job. Specially those situations where radical candor in a depleted trust scenario has worked against me.</p> <p>While researching more on the topic, I chanced upon a comment. It struck a chord so deep that I am compelled to copy an excrept from this comment by @grandalf on hackernew in this thread</p> <p>\"If there is sufficient trust, there is no issue with candor because you just say what you want, and everyone knows you are trying to make things better.

Everytime failed radical candor scenario in my personal experiece was either because we were in a depleted trust sutuation or there was an error in the way candor was practiced.</p> <p>Trust is the invisible thread that holds Radical Candor together. Without it, the entire framework falls apart. Imagine giving Alex that tough feedback without a foundation of trust\u2014how do you think they'd react? Probably not well. They might feel demoralized, defensive, or even resentful.</p>","tags":["topic/leadership","topic/management","topic/culture"]},{"location":"2024/09/04/navigating-radical-candor-the-delicate-balance-between-trust-and-honesty/#forstering-a-culture-of-trust","title":"Forstering a Culture of Trust","text":"<p>Drawing insights from that insightful Hacker News comment, let's look at some scenarios where managers could unknowingly be creating a low-trust environment These scenarios also act like a red herring to assess trust in your teams.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Finger-Pointing and Pressure to Lowball Estimates When a project falls    behind schedule, the natural instinct for some managers might be to start    pointing fingers and putting undue pressure on the team to deliver. They    demand tighter, more conservative estimates, even if it means setting the    team up for failure. This kind of behavior erodes trust, as the team    perceives the manager as more interested in protecting their own position    than genuinely supporting the team's success. As the Hacker News commenter    said, \"When there is finger pointing and pressure to lowball estimates, there    is a trust breakdown from the outset.\" Instead, the manager should focus on    adjusting scope or timelines collaboratively, demonstrating that they're in    it together with the team.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lack of Transparency around Performance and Growth Another trust-eroding    scenario is when managers are not transparent about performance evaluations    and growth opportunities. If team members feel like the criteria for    advancement are unclear or that the process is biased, they're less likely to    trust that their manager has their best interests in mind. As the commenter    noted, \"It must be OK to be honest in either direction, which means the firm    should respect it if the employee wishes to leave, and the employee should    respect it if the firm isn't happy with performance and there doesn't appear    to be a path to improvement.\" Fostering that level of mutual respect and    transparency is key to building trust.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inconsistent or Insincere Feedback When managers provide feedback    inconsistently or in a way that feels insincere, it can severely undermine    trust. If the team perceives that the manager is \"sugarcoating\" issues or not    being fully transparent, they'll start to doubt the manager's motives and    credibility. It gets worse the higher up you are and the more ambiguous your    responsibilities are. Truth be told, I have seen a lot more incompetent    bosses who were perfectly fine humans but really unprepared people leaders. A    tell-tale sign of your boss not being up to the mark is when you see them    delegate doing the dirty work. They deliver bad news by proxy or take tough    decisions in the shadows and make others deliver it for them, often with    justifications galore and sugarcoating. This subturfuge is often plainly    obvious and makes them loose trust and credibility.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Building a culture of trust isn't a one-time effort. It's an ongoing process that requires consistency, transparency, and a genuine commitment to the well-being of your team. It's about having the tough conversations, not just when things go wrong, but also when they're going right. It's about recognizing the good, while still pushing for better.</p> <p>There's a phrase that I've come across:</p> <p>\"Radical Candor can't exist without Radical Trust and Radical Acceptance of feedback\"</p> <p>It struck a chord with me because it highlights the interconnectedness of the person giving feedback and the one receiving it. You can't just focus on being candid without also working on trust before hand and the person listening to be accepting of your feedback.</p> <p>If you ask me, this comment sums it up.</p> <p>\"If there is sufficient trust, there is no issue with candor because you just say what you want, and everyone knows you are trying to make things better. When trust breaks down, your words might seem critical or like personal attacks.\" Maintaining a consistent, genuine approach to feedback is crucial for building that foundation of trust.</p> <p>The key takeaway is that trust is fragile and easily eroded when managers act in ways that are perceived as self-serving, dishonest, or inconsistent. By focusing on transparency, mutual respect, and a genuine commitment to the team's success, managers can create an environment where Radical Candor can truly thrive. If trust is present, then the next key ingredient will be caring personally and challenging directly.

It's particularly valuable for those working with AI APIs, where exposed credentials can lead to significant security breaches and unexpected costs.</p> <p>Remember, as you continue your journey in AI development or any field requiring API keys and other secrets:</p> <ul> <li>Regularly audit your public repositories for any accidentally exposed     credentials</li> <li>Consider implementing this PGP + SOPS solution as part of your standard     development workflow</li> <li>Educate your team or community about the importance of secure credential     management</li> </ul> <p>For those looking to take their security posture to the next level, consider exploring more advanced setups supported by SOPS, such as integrating with AWS KMS for larger-scale key management, or incorporating these practices into your CI/CD pipelines.</p> <p>Securing your secrets doesn't have to come at the cost of collaboration or convenience. With the approach outlined in this guide, you can embrace the open, sharing culture of the developer community while keeping your sensitive information locked down tight.</p> <p>Stay curious, keep experimenting with AI, and above all, keep your secrets secret.

You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread.

As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father! Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d I snapped. You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs. Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me?

The Wyse WY-370introduced new color modes, including a direct-indexed 64-color palette. (See Page 86 of its Programmer\u2019s Guide.)</li> <li>38 and 48 are the most important parameters for selecting colors today, but they weren\u2019t allocated by either the4th(1986) or5th(1991) editions. So where did they come from? The 5th edition gives a clue:   <p>reserved for future standardization; intended for setting character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT Recommendation T.416]</p> </li> <li>ISO 8613 was a boondoggle of a project intended to standardize and replace all proprietary document file formats. You\u2019ve never heard of it, so it obviously failed. But its legacy lives on \u2013 ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) (1993) built on ECMA-48\u2019s codes and defined parameters 38 and 48 as extended foreground and background color modes, respectively.   <p>The first parameter element indicates a choice between:  </p> <ul> <li>0 implementation defined (only applicable for the character foreground colour)  </li> <li>1 transparent;  </li> <li>2 direct colour in RGB space;  </li> <li>3 direct colour in CMY space;  </li> <li>4 direct colour in CMYK space;  </li> <li>5 indexed colour.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>There we go! That is why 5 is used for 256-color mode and 2 is 24-bit RGB.</p> <p>Careful reading also gives a clue as to the semicolon vs. colon syntax screw-up. Note the subtle use of the term \u201cparameter element\u201d vs. \u201cparameter\u201d.</p> <p>If you read ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) and ECMA-48 closely, it\u2019s not explicitly stated, but they seem to indicate that unknown parameters for commands like \u201cselect graphics rendition\u201d should be ignored. And parameters are separated with semicolons.</p> <p>That implies <code>ESC[38;5;3m</code> should be interpreted, in terminals that don\u2019t support SGR 38, as \u201cunknown, ignored (38)\u201d, \u201cblinking (5)\u201d, and \u201citalicized (3)\u201d. The syntax should use colons to separate sub-parameter components, but something got lost along the way.</p> <p>(Now, in practice, programs are told how to communicate with their terminals via the TERM variable and the terminfo database, so I don\u2019t know how much pain occurs in reality.)</p> <p>Thomas Dickey has done a great job documenting the history ofncurses andxterm, and, lo and behold, explains exactly the origin of the ambiguous syntax:</p> <p>We used semicolon (like other SGR parameters) for separating the R/G/B values in the escape sequence, since a copy of ITU T.416 (ISO-8613-6) which presumably clarified the use of colon for this feature was costly.</p> <p>Using semicolon was incorrect because some applications could expect their parameters to be order-independent. As used for the R/G/B values, that was order-dependent. The relevant information, by the way, is part of ECMA-48 (not ITU T.416, as mentioned in Why only 16 (or 256) colors?). Quoting from section 5.4.2 of ECMA-48, page 12, and adding emphasis (not in the standard):</p> <p>Each parameter sub-string consists of one or more bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/10; the bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/09 represent the digits ZERO to NINE; bit combination 03/10 may be used as a separator in a parameter sub-string, for example, to separate the fractional part of a decimal number from the integer part of that number.</p> <p>and later on page 78, in 8.3.117 SGR \u2013 SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION, the description of SGR 38:</p> <p>(reserved for future standardization; intended for setting character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT Recommendation T.416])</p> <p>Of course you will immediately recognize that 03/10 is ASCII colon, and that ISO 8613-6 necessarily refers to the encoding in a parameter sub-string. Or perhaps you will not.</p> <p>So it\u2019s all because the ANSI and ISO standards are ridiculously expensive (to this day, these crappy PDF scans from the 90s and earlier are $200 USD!) and because they use a baroque syntax to denote ASCII characters. While writing this post, I had to keep <code>man ascii</code>open to match, for example, <code>03/10</code> to colon and <code>03/11</code> to semicolon. I guess it\u2019s how standards were written back then. A Hacker News thread in the context of WezTerm gives more detail.</p> <p>So, to recap in the timeline:</p> <ul> <li>1999: Thomas Dickey merged Todd Larason\u2019s 256-color patcheswith ambiguous semicolon syntax.</li> <li>2006: Konsole added support for 256-color and 24-bit truecolor using the same ambiguous syntax as xterm, with a follow-on discussion about colons vs. semicolons. The issue was noticed, but semicolon syntax was adopted anyway.</li> <li>2012: Thomas Dickey fixed xterm to accept the standards-compliant syntax.</li> <li>2016: Windows 10\u2019s built-in console gained ANSI escape code support, including 24-bit colors. Unfortunately with the ambiguous semicolon syntax.</li> <li>2019: Windows Terminal is released, with ANSI escape code support, but also using ambiguous semicolon syntax.</li> <li>2022: Microsoft announced ecosystem-wide migrationfrom the legacy framebuffer-based VGA-style console subsystem to ANSI terminal emulation, specifically using xterm as a guide.</li> <li>2022: Konsole gains support for standards-compliant syntax.</li> </ul> <p>Okay, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve established:</p> <ul> <li>ANSI codes are widely supported, even on Windows.</li> <li>Truecolor support is either widely supported or (for example, on the Linux text mode terminal) at least recognized and mapped to a more limited palette.</li> <li>Semicolon syntax is the most compatible, though the unambiguous colon syntax is slowly spreading.</li> </ul> <p>I wrote a small colortest.rs program to test color support and attributes like reverse and italicsto confirm the above in every terminal I use.</p>"},{"location":"Bookmarks/Omnivore/2024-01-31/I%20Just%20Wanted%20Emacs%20to%20Look%20Nice%20%E2%80%94%20Using%2024-Bit%20Color%20in%20Terminals%20%20Chad%20Austin/#terminfo","title":"Terminfo","text":"<p>Now that we\u2019ve established terminal capabilities and how to use them, the next trick is to convince software of varying lineages to detect and use the best color support available.</p> <p>Typically, this is done with the oldterminfo library (or the even older termcap).</p> <p>Terminfo provides a database of terminal capabilities and the ability to generate appropriate escape sequences.

I believe they stand for \u201cSet ANSI Foreground\u201d and \u201cSet ANSI Background\u201d. Each takes a single argument, the color number.</li> </ul> <p>Those percent signs are a parameter arithmetic and substitution language.

We\u2019ll decode that next.</li> </ul> <p>Here\u2019s where Terminfo\u2019s limitations cause us trouble. Terminfo and ncurses are tied at the hip. Their programming model is that there are N palette entries, each of which has a default RGB value, and terminals may support overriding any palette entry\u2019s RGB value.</p> <p>The <code>-direct</code> terminals, however, are different. They represent 24-bit colors by pretending there are 16.7 million palette entries, each of which maps to the 8:8:8 RGB cube, but whose values cannot be changed.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s look at the new <code>setaf</code>:</p> <pre><code>print \"\\E[\"\nif p1 &lt; 8 {\n  print \"3\" p1\n} else {\n  print \"38:2::\" (p1 / 65536) \":\" ((p1 / 256) &amp; 255) \":\" (p1 &amp; 255)\n}\nprint \"m\"\n</code></pre> <p>It\u2019s not quite as simple as direct RGB. For compatibility with programs that assume the meaning of <code>setaf</code>, this scheme steals the darkest 7 blues, not including black, and uses them for compatibility with the basic ANSI 8 colors. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk of legacy programs outputting barely-visible dark blues instead of the ANSI colors they expect.</p> <p>One consequence is that the <code>-direct</code> schemes are incompatible with the <code>-256color</code> schemes, so programs must be aware that 256 colors means indexed and 16.7 million means direct, except that the darkest 7 blues are to be avoided.</p> <p>Fundamentally, terminfo has no notion of color space. So a program that was written before terminfo even supported more colors than 256 might (validly!) assume the values of the first 8, 16, or even 256 palette entries.</p> <p>This explains an issue with the Rust cratetermwiz that I recently ran into at work. Aprogram expected to output colors in the xterm-256color palette, but was actually generating various illegibly-dark shades of blue. (Note: Despite the fact that the issue is open as of this writing, @quark-zju landed a fix, so current termwiz behaves reasonably.)</p> <p>This is a terminfo restriction, not a terminal restriction. As far as I know, every terminal that supports 24-bit color also supports the xterm 256-color palette and even dynamically changing their RGB values. (You can even animate the palettelike The Secret of Monkey Island did!) While I appreciate Thomas Dickey\u2019s dedication to accurately documenting history and preserving compatibility, terminfo simply isn\u2019t great at accurate and timely descriptions of today\u2019s vibrant ecosystem of terminal emulators.</p> <p>Kovid Goyal, author of kitty,expresses his frustration:</p> <p>To summarize, one cannot have both 256 and direct color support in one terminfo file.</p> <p>Frustrated users of the ncurses library have only themselves to blame, for choosing to use such a bad library.</p> <p>A deeper, more accurate discussion of the challenges are documented inkitty issue #879.</p> <p>In an ideal world, terminfo would have introduced a brand new capability for 24-bit RGB, leaving the adjustable 256-color palette in place.</p> <p>Modern programs should probably disregard most of terminfo and assume that 16.7 million colors implies support for the rest of the color capabilities. And maybe generate their own ANSI-compatible escape sequences\u2026 except for the next wrinkle.</p>"},{"location":"Bookmarks/Omnivore/2024-01-31/I%20Just%20Wanted%20Emacs%20to%20Look%20Nice%20%E2%80%94%20Using%2024-Bit%20Color%20in%20Terminals%20%20Chad%20Austin/#setting-term-semicolons-again","title":"Setting TERM: Semicolons Again!","text":"<p>Gripes about terminfo aside, everyone uses it, so we do need to ensure TERM is set correctly.</p> <p>While I\u2019d like to standardize on the colon-based SGR syntax, several terminals I use only support semicolons:</p> <ul> <li>Conhost, Windows\u2019s built-in console.</li> <li>Mintty claims to work(and wsltty does), but for some reason running my colortest.rs programfrom Cygwin only works with semicolon syntax, unless I pipe the output through <code>cat</code> or a file.

This presentation will describe the different types of virtual memory spaces and mappings used in the Linux kernel, the cases in which they are useful, how they are implemented in the kernel, and how they differ from user space memory. Concepts such as the hardware memory-management unit (MMU) and translation lookaside buffer (TLB) will be discussed, as well as software concepts like kernel page tables. User space concepts such as growable stacks, memory paging, memory mapping, page faults, exceptions, and other memory-related conditions will be covered as well.</p> <p>About Matt Porter</p> <p>Matt Porter is the CTO of Konsulko Group. At Konsulko, he works on design and development of software for the Linux kernel and other FOSS projects. Matt has contributed to a number of Linux related projects over his years of community involvement including the various part of the kernel, Debian, RapidIO, Beagleboard.org, and many others. Matt is currently working on GPGPU and eBPF hacks for Linux.

Your Linux servers may already be running BPF programs; Netflix cloud instances run 15 by default, and Facebook over 40. These programs are for networking, performance tools, security policies, device drivers, application proxies, and more. Many have said that BPF is taking over Linux.</p> <p>This talk is a deep dive that describes how BPF works internally and dissects some modern performance observability tools. Details covered include the kernel BPF implementation: the verifier, JIT compilation, and the BPF execution environment; the BPF instruction set; different event sources; and how BPF is used by user space, using bpftrace programs as an example.

It's a hard challenge since a piece of code doesn't reveal anything about its socio-technical context. Enter behavioral code analysis, an approach which combines code level metrics with data on how teams interact within the code. Armed with these techniques, we look to reduce organizational friction by focusing on a set of common challenges:</p> <p>\u2022 Identify architectural coordination bottlenecks and understand the technical root causes. \u2022 Visualize implicit dependencies between teams, act to decouple teams. \u2022 Discover knowledge risks by measuring the Truck Factor. Learn how to mitigate it. \u2022 Communicate the scaling risks inherent in Brooks's Law by showing data on how it impacts your delivery. \u2022 Go beyond technical impact by knowing how bad code causes unhappiness, low morale, and increased attrition.</p> <p>All techniques are demonstrated with examples from real-world codebases. If you are a senior developer, software architect, or technical lead, this presentation will change how you view code. So join in to learn why technical decisions are never merely technical, and how you can stay a step ahead by preventing socio-technical smells. [...]</p> <p>TIMECODES 00:00 Intro 01:40 1.

That's the power of firsts principle learning. This series will aim to bring hands on first principles for a small part of the Linux kernel stack. </p> <p>I also have an ulterior motive. I want to make sure you get a friendly tour of a small relatable part of the Linux kernel so that you aren't afraid to look further, on your own, with confidence. Shadow learning as Randy Pausch would call it.  I wish to ignite a small match, which makes you wonder, Now that I know how Networking works, I wonder how my GPU works? or my NVME?  I hope this curiosity, coupled with some tips and tricks you learn throughout, would fuel the Engineers to look around and gain depth. </p> <p>So, whether you're a seasoned pro looking to level up your skills or a newbie eager to dive into the deep end, this series has something for you.

The kevat didn't take any money from Shree Ram, mentioning he and the lord were in the same profession.  Shree ram wondered, how is this possible and inquired.

We go about it in ways which signal our journey from immature to mature. </p> <p>We first try with adharma. By hook and crook.  We are immature and want to be happy quickly.  We realize this isn't sustainable and doesnt work Then we pendulum to the other extreme. We try to be too good, we over do it. We think by adding good karma in bucket load, we will be happy, we again fail to realize that such karma may make you content and happy but it doesnt take the pain away from the daily sufferings of life.
